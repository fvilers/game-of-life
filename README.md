# game-of-life

A simple implementation of [Conway's Game of Life](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Conway%27s_Game_of_Life) in JavaScript and p5js.

## How to

Update the constants at the top of the file to change the size and rendering of the grid.

const ROWS = 50; // Number of grid rows
const COLS = 100; // Number of grid columns
const SCALE = 10; // Grid scale (higher the bigger)
```
